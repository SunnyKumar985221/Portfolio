        As a full stack developer with over 2+ years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. I am skilled in a variety of modern technologies, including React.js, node.js, and many more. I have experience building and maintaining both web responsive applications.
        I completed my Engineering degree from the National Institute of Technology Sikkim in the academic year 2017-2021,
        and am a certified front-end developer in React by Coursera, and I have many certifications in the field of full stack development, such as a JavaScript beginner certification.
         In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field, and am always looking for ways to expand my skillset.
